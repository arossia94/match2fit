# match2fit
Mathematica package to interface UV-EFT matching codes with SMEFT global fit codes. Currently, it interfaces matchmakereft and SMEFiT and is limited to tree-level matching results.

matchmakereft is a prerequisite for full functionality and hence requires using Linux/Mac as OS. 
Except for the matching functionality, the rest of the match2fit package should work on Windows too.

# Usage
See the User's Manual and the PackageTester notebook for usage examples.
